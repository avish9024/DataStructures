Immutable class :-
Immutable class means once we created the object, we can't change its content.
In Java, all the wrapper classes like Integer, Long, Byte, Short and String class are immutable classes.
We can create our own immutable classes as well.

For creating our own immutable classes:-
1. The class must be declared as final (If you don't mark the class final, it might be possible for me
   to suddenly make your seemingly immutable class actually mutable)
2. Data members must be declared as private (so that it can't be easily accessible)
3. Data members must be declared as final (so that we can't the change the object after creation)
4. A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields by performing the deep copy (so that the object can't be
   modified using the object reference)
5. Deep Copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods (To return a copy rather than
   returning the actual object reference)
6. No setter methods (To not have the option to change the value of the instance variable)
