Singleton class :-

A singleton class is a class which can have only one instance at a time.
After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class,
the new variable also points to the first instance created.
So whatever modifications we do to any variable inside the class through any instance,
it affects the variable of the single instance created and
is visible if we access that variable through any variable of that class type defined.

For making a class as singleton,
1. Make the constructor as private
2. Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class

Uses :-
It is used to provide global point of access to the object.
In terms of practical use Singleton patterns are used in logging, configuration settings.
