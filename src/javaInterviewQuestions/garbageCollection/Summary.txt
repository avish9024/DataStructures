In Java, garbage means unreferenced objects.

Garbage collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. In other words, it is a way to destroy the unused objects.
In java, it is performed automatically. So , java provides better memory management.

advantages :-
* It makes java memory efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
* It is automatically done by the garbage collector (a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts)

How can an object be unreferenced ?
There are many ways :-
* By nullifying the reference - Employee e = new Employee(); e = null;
* By assigning a reference to another - Employee  e1 = new Employee(); Employee e2 = new Employee(); e1 = e2;
* By anonymous object - new Employee();

finalize() method :-
It is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected. this method can be used to perform cleanup processing.
This method is defined in Object class

gc() method :-
It is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing. The gc() is found in System and runtime classes
