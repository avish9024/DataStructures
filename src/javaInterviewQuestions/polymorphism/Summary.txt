The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of
a message to be displayed in more than one form. It is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented
Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways.In other words, polymorphism allows
you to define one interface and multiple implementations. The word poly means many and morphs means forms, so it means
many forms.

In Java, polymorphism is mainly divided into two types :-
* Compile-time polymorphism
* Run-time polymorphism

1. Compile-time polymorphism
It is also known as static polymorphism. This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator
overloading. But Java doesn't support Operator overloading.

Method Overloading :- When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions
are said to be overloaded.Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.

2. Runtime polymorphism:-
It is also known as dynamic method dispatch.It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved
at runtime.This type of polymorphism is achieved by method overriding.

Method overriding occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class.The base
class function is said to be overridden.
